				<h2>Services</h2>
				<h3>Leisure Services Planning and Management</h3>
				<p>
					The <span class="upper">Rethink Group</span> provides a wide range of planning and management services for
					the leisure services field - based on the close to 50 years of experience of the
					principals - working with all levels of government, NGOs, non-profit organizations
					and the commercial sector.  We've completed close to 150 assignments in this
					sector. The following types of projects define the breadth of our work and experience.
				</p>
				<h4>Parks, Recreation and Culture Master Plans, Strategic Plans and Leisure Service Strategies</h4>
				<p>
					These plans and strategies provide comprehensive direction to municipalities typically
					for ten years.
				</p>
				<p>
					The staff in the Ontario office of the <span class="upper">Rethink Group</span> have completed 37 of these types of
					assignments for communities of all sizes across Ontario and in Western Canada.
				</p>
				<h4>Facility Feasibility Studies and Needs Assessments</h4>
				<p>
					Typically, these studies comprise a needs and financial feasibility assessment, a process
					that defines the characteristics of the facility and usually a conceptual plan for the
					facility and site.  
				</p>
				<p>
					The staff in the Ontario office of the <span class="upper">Rethink Group</span> have completed 49 of these types of
					studies and plans for communities and organizations across Ontario and nationally
					(from arenas and multi-facility complexes to seniors and youth centres + older adult,
					leisure programming and volunteer engagement strategies).  For feasibility studies, we
					collaborate with architects, landscape architects, engineers and cost specialists.
				</p>
				<h4>Open Space, Trails and Waterfront Planning</h4>
				<p>
					The staff in the Ontario office of the <span class="upper">Rethink Group</span> have completed 24 of these types of
					assignments, including park/open space system assessments and plans, studies for
					conservation authorities, recreational waterway plans, waterfront and marina studies and
					plans, trail plans, and input into park and outdoor facility designs. See samples projects
					below.

					TODO: sample projects
				</p>
				<h4>Forecasting and Customized Trend Scans</h4>
				<p>
					The <span class="upper">Rethink Group</span> is known internationally for our industry-leading trend research and
					forecasting for the leisure field.  The <span class="upper">Rethink Group</span> is constantly monitoring trends that
					impact leisure interests and service delivery.  We have prepared customized trend scans and
					reports, as well as trend newsletters for this and other sectors.
				</p>
				<p>
					Examples of publications include:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>&quot;The Elora Prescription&quot;</li>
					<li>&quot;LEISURE WATCH Canada&quot; (18 editions)</li>
					<li>&quot;Foresight – Acting on Trends That Matter&quot;</li>
					<li>&quot;Leisure Trends and the Older Adult&quot;</li>
					<li>&quot;Rethinking Leisure Services&quot;</li>

				</ul>
				<h4>Other Types of Leisure Services Assignments</h4>
				<p>
					These include Marketing Strategies and Plans and Operational, Restructuring, Mandate
					and Policy Reviews.
				</p>
				<h3>Strategic Planning and Visioning</h3>
				<p>
					Another of our areas of specialty is strategic planning and visioning.  We've made a
					commitment to nurturing visionary and strategic leadership.  From our Ontario office,
					we've completed close to 50 strategic plans, service strategies and visioning projects.
					Our clients have mainly been non-profit organizations and municipalities.
				</p>
				<h3>Volunteer Engagement</h3>
				<p>
					Volunteers are the 'unpaid' staff of organizations.  We will work with organizations
					to develop volunteer engagement strategies, as well as satisfaction surveys, program
					audits and service assessments. We offer a wide variety of services to help organizations
					&quot;attract, support and expand&quot; their volunteer resources.  We also provide
					customized training for staff and volunteers. In addition, we offer policy and procedure
					development, and prepare customized training materials and manuals.
				</p>
				<h3>Community and Stakeholder Engagement</h3>
				<p>
					The RETHINK GROUP has always placed a great deal of emphasis and importance on informing
					and engaging stakeholders, community leaders, user groups and residents to inform needs
					assessments and the planning process - integrating a variety of effective techniques that
					are custom-designed to suit each assignment.
				</p>
				<p>
					Through hundreds of sessions, we've demonstrated outstanding skill and innovation in
					working with diverse groups and communities to understand their perspectives and issues,
					and to guide them toward a shared vision of the future.  
				</p>
				<p>
					The Firm has provided input into community and regional plans strategic plans, parks and
					recreation plans and strategies, policing plans and service strategies for social service
					agencies.  We've worked with elected officials and senior staff in municipalities, government
					and non-profit agencies; architects; planners; engineers; policy makers; service providers;
					facility managers; and volunteer boards of directors. 
				</p>
				<p>
					We can design an engagement program that ensures that you hear from those you need to reach
					and guarantees that all involved know they've been effectively heard.
				</p>
				<h3>Customized Coaching, Presentations and Workshops</h3>
				<p>
					The partners at the <span class="upper">Rethink Group</span> have delivered hundreds of keynote addresses, conference
					workshops/training sessions, customized information and educational workshops, webinars, a
					community college Certificate Course in Volunteer Management, two online Volunteer Management
					courses designed for Charity Village, and customized training and coaching for individual clients.
				</p>
				<h3>Strategic Advisers</h3>
				<p>
					Increasingly, the partners at the <span class="upper">Rethink Group</span> are being asked by municipalities and
					other firms to act as strategic advisers in our areas of expertise to guide, inform
					and otherwise assist with needs/demand assessments, feasibility studies, planning projects,
					service reviews and other assignments.  Typically, we join their team to:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>provide advice about process, research and community engagement techniques;</li>
					<li>assist with analysis and recommendations;</li>
					<li>complete one or more components of the assignment (e.g., the community engagement program, trends research, a specific component of the analysis and/or recommendations); and</li>
					<li>report writing.</li>
				</ul>
